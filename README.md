## Overview

The **Expense Tracker** is a desktop application built using Python's `tkinter` library. It allows users to efficiently manage their personal or business expenses by storing details like the payee, amount, description, and mode of payment. This application supports adding, editing, viewing, and deleting expense records, along with converting the details into a readable sentence format.

This project was developed during my industrial training, showcasing my skills in GUI development, database management, and software functionality.

## Features

- **Add Expense**: Record new expenses with details like date, payee, description, amount, and mode of payment.
- **View Expense**: Select an expense to view all its details.
- **Edit Expense**: Modify existing expense records.
- **Delete Expense**: Remove a single expense or all expenses from the database.
- **Expense to Words**: Convert expense details into a readable sentence format.
